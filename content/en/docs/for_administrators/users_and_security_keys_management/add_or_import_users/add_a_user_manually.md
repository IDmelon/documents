Administrators can manually add individual users to the IDmelon Admin Panel. This method is ideal for small-scale onboarding or when adding a specific user outside of bulk operations.

Steps to Add a User Manually:

1. Log in to the IDmelon Admin Panel.
2. Navigate to **Users > All Users**, then click on **New User**.
3. In the pop-up window, complete the required user details:
   - User ID
   - Email (if applicable)
   - First Name and Last Name
   - Group (optional, but recommended for applying specific permissions and access rights)
4. Click **Done** to complete the user creation process.
5. After saving, a prompt will appear asking whether you'd like to immediately assign a security key to the user. You can choose from the following key types:
   - Contactless card
   - Smartphone
   - Fingerprint
   - USB key
6. Alternatively, you may skip this step and assign a key later through the user's profile in the Admin Panel.
