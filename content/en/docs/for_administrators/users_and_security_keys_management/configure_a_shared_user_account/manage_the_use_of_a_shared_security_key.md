2. Name the policy (e.g., **Allow Policy**) and set it as the highest priority.
3. On the next page:
   - Select **Card** as the Security Key Type.
   - Under **Users and Groups**, choose the shared account.
   - Under **Access Restriction on PCs**, select the target shared PC.
   - Set the action to **Allow**.
4. Submit and confirm.

Another record as Block is required to deny any other user account on the target shared PC.
