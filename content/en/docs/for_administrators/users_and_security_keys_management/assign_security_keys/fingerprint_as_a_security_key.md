IDmelon supports the use of biometric authentication—specifically fingerprints—as a FIDO2 security key. This method offers strong, user-friendly authentication while eliminating the need for passwords.

## Prerequisites

To use a fingerprint as a security key, ensure the following:

- A compatible fingerprint reader is connected to the user’s PC.
- The IDmelon Fingerprint Driver is downloaded and installed from the IDmelon website.

## Assign a Fingerprint to a User

Admins can assign a fingerprint as a FIDO2 security key to a user through the Admin Panel.

1. Navigate to **Users > All Users**, and select the desired user.
2. Go to the **Security Keys** tab and click **+ New Security Key**.
3. Select **Fingerprint** as the security key type.
4. You will be redirected to a fingerprint onboarding page.
5. Follow the prompts to scan and register one or more fingers.

Once onboarding is complete, the user can authenticate using their fingerprint as a FIDO2 security key across supported applications and services.
