A Shared Account simplifies access to shared workspace resources by allowing multiple users or groups to securely utilize the same login credentials. This setup is particularly useful in scenarios where individual accounts are impractical or unnecessary, such as:

- Kiosks, shared PCs, or generic access points.
- Environments where multiple users need access to the same resource without the overhead of creating individual accounts.
