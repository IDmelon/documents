## What Happens Next?

- The user you designated will now appear as a Shared Account under the **Security Keys** column in the **All Users** menu.
- For the users receiving the shared credentials, a new **Shared Passkeys** tab will show who shared their credentials and the corresponding passkeys.

## Notes

- If the Contactless Card policy changes, affected users need to sync their PCs with the server to apply updates.
- A manual sync can be triggered by toggling the internet connection off and on.
- Shared accounts provide a secure way to allow access without exposing individual credentials.
